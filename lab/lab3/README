Lab 3
Objective: Create a simple oauth2 client that obtains an access token and fetches a resource

Task 1 -------------

From this folder, run the following
>cd simple-oauth2-api-client
>mvn jetty:run

This will start the simple-oauth2-api-client in jetty

Open your browser and point it to http://localhost:8080 to access the application

Expected outcome:

You will end up at the first page saying that we need to navigate to Mina v√•rdkontakter in order to authorize usage of the scheduling API.

When you click the link, nothing will happen, yet.


Task 2 -------------

Find the controller method corresponding to http://localhost:8080/ in the Java code.
Inspect the following code and insert into the controller method to generate the correct URL to the authorization dialog.

..... To be continued
